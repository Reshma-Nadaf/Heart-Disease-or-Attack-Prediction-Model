OVERVIEW:

Heart Disease is among the most prevalent chronic diseases in the United States,
impacting millions of Americans each year and exerting a significant financial burden
on the economy. In the United States alone, heart disease claims roughly 647,000 lives
each year — making it the leading cause of death.
According to the World Health Organization, despite significant advances in diagnosis and treatment, 
mortality from heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for about one-third of 
annual deaths

OBJECTIVE:

• Provide the best performing model to determine probability for a patient having a heart disease or attack.

• Providing the most important drivers for a heart disease or attack.

In this project model for predicting this heart disease have been trained, validated and tested.
The most important drivers for a heart disease or attack are found.
As the dataset is imbalanced techniques such as oversampling, undersampling to have been used.
This is a classification problem so various classifications algorithms have been used such as
- RandomForestClassifier
- Logistic Regression
- DecisionTreeClassifier
- XGBoost Algorithm

Each algorithm have been evaluated against precision, recall and accuracy scores.
In the critical context of diagnosing heart disease, primary objective is to ensure a high recall for the positive class.
